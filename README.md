# Proxmox Tuya-Convert v2.0 Container 

### Updated October 5th. 

Whiskerz007 put a lot of time and effort in to making this awesome process available easily on ProxMox. If it wasn't for Whiskerz007 I wouldn't know about ProxMox.

Now that the Tuya-Convert has been merged back to the main Github, there is no need for my fork. (My fork was always meant to be temporary. Please refer to Whiskerz007 Github for further Tuya-Convert Installations.

Of course if you need assistant I would be happy to assist in Discord.
